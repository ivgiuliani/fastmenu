A fast shortcut menu.

Will read `$HOME/.fastmenu` and display a dmenu-based menu from where
to select the right item. The config file defines the list of items to
display in the menu in the format `label | path`. If you want to use
something other than the pipe as a separator, edit the `SEP` constant
in fm.py.


i3 configuration
----------------
Add something like this to the configuration:

bindsym $mod+Shift+w exec /path/to/fm-run.sh
